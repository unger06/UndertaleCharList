      <h1>DETAILS</h1>
      <p>Undertale (stylized as UNDERTALE and formerly UnderTale) is a role-playing game developed independently by Toby Fox 
      with additional art by Temmie Chang.</p>
      
      <h1>BATTLE SYSTEM</h1>
      <p>The battle system in Undertale is turn-based. During the enemy's turn, they attack with bullet hell patterns. 
      The Player must move the protagonist's SOUL, represented by a red heart, to avoid attacks. As the game progresses, 
      new elements are introduced in the form of Attack Types and SOUL Modes. Attacks can be in different colors, some 
      of which can heal the SOUL or be an obstacle. SOUL modes alter the SOUL's color and how it functions in a battle, 
      and is often used during a Boss battle.</p>
    
      <p>During the protagonist's turn, they can use one of the four options per turn: FIGHT, ACT, ITEM, and MERCY. 
      FIGHT damages the opponent with a quick-time event. Selecting an ACT can change the opponent's mood, or reveal 
      information on the enemy. Using an item can benefit the protagonist. If certain conditions are met, MERCY can be 
      selected to spare the enemy, which ends the combat. At the end of the battle, GOLD is earned. Killing an enemy 
      rewards EXP and LV, but neither are given if an enemy is successfully spared. Undertale emphasizes on the morality 
      of killing and sparing the Monsters encountered, as the player's actions determine the ending. Unlike traditional 
      RPGs, it is possible to complete Undertale without killing monsters.</p>
      
      <h1>SPARE OR KILL</h1>
      <p>The overworld mostly consists of puzzles that the player must solve to progress. Battles can also be seen as puzzles, 
      as it can require the right set of ACTs to resolve the fight peacefully. However, if the player decides to kill every 
      monster they can find, many puzzles are disabled. In this situation, the player is required to grind encounters to 
      progress the game. Unlike traditional RPGs, grinding, backtracking, and the few sidequests are all optional.</p>
      
      <h1>CONSEQUENCES</h1>
      <p>Undertale features witty and humorous dialogue, with occasional fourth wall breaks. The dialogue and locations can 
      be drastically altered based on the player's actions. This ranges from minor options, killing and sparing monsters, 
      and the SAVE feature. For the latter, almost every major character possesses meta-knowledge. If the player quits or 
      resets the game without a TRUE RESET, these characters comment on the player's past action, or have a sense of 
      familiarity from past playthroughs.</p>
